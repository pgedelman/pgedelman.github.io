        <p className='white-box intro'>
          &emsp;I am a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student at the University of Delaware. 
          Going into my sophomore year, I am excited for the new opportunities that will come my way. I've always loved computers, 
          and for the past 3 years programming has been my outlet. With school, personal projects, Leetcode, and a research position 
          at Delaware State University, Iâ€™ve immersed myself in the world of computer science. The heart of my professional 
          interests involve seeing real outcomes from my programming, whether that be in machinery or a fine-tuned neural network.
